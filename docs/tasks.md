# UCI Protocol Implementation Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of actionable tasks to improve the UCI protocol implementation. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Grammar and Parsing Improvements

- [ ] Update the ANTLR grammar file (Uci.g4) to include all UCI commands supported by the interfaces
  - [ ] Add 'go' command and its variants (depth, movetime, etc.)
  - [ ] Add 'setoption' command
  - [ ] Fix the swapped 'name' and 'author' rules in the grammar
- [ ] Enhance error handling in the parser to provide meaningful error messages for malformed commands
- [ ] Add support for additional UCI commands not currently implemented (e.g., 'debug', 'register')
- [ ] Implement validation for command parameters (e.g., valid move formats, FEN string validation)

## Code Structure and Architecture

- [ ] Refactor the TangoUciVisitor class to improve readability and maintainability
  - [ ] Break down long conditional expressions into more readable code
  - [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement the empty methods in AbstractUCIEngine with default behaviors
- [ ] Create a more robust mechanism for handling unknown or malformed commands
- [ ] Consider implementing the Builder pattern for complex command objects (e.g., ReqGo variants)
- [ ] Evaluate and potentially refactor the class hierarchy for better separation of concerns

## Documentation Improvements

- [ ] Add comprehensive JavaDoc to all public classes and methods
- [ ] Create detailed examples for common use cases
- [ ] Document the ANTLR grammar rules and their relationship to the Java classes
- [ ] Add inline comments for complex logic
- [ ] Create a developer guide explaining the architecture and extension points
- [ ] Update README.md with more detailed usage examples and configuration options

## Testing Enhancements

- [ ] Increase test coverage for edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Add integration tests that simulate real-world UCI protocol exchanges
- [ ] Create performance tests for parsing large command sequences
- [ ] Implement property-based testing for command parsing
- [ ] Add tests for concurrent command processing
- [ ] Ensure tests are consistent with the grammar file and interfaces

## Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Profile the parser to identify performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for large command sequences
- [ ] Consider implementing caching for frequently used command patterns
- [ ] Evaluate thread safety and potential for parallel processing
- [ ] Optimize string handling in command parsing and formatting

## Feature Additions

- [ ] Implement support for UCI extensions (e.g., UCI_Chess960)
- [ ] Add logging capabilities for debugging and monitoring
- [ ] Create utilities for common UCI operations (e.g., position setup, time management)
- [ ] Implement a command history mechanism
- [ ] Add support for asynchronous command processing
- [ ] Consider implementing a higher-level API for common chess operations

## Build and Deployment

- [ ] Update dependency versions to latest stable releases
- [ ] Configure continuous integration for automated testing
- [ ] Set up code quality checks (e.g., SonarQube, SpotBugs)
- [ ] Implement automated release process
- [ ] Create comprehensive release notes
- [ ] Consider publishing documentation to a dedicated site

## Compatibility and Interoperability

- [ ] Test with multiple chess engines to ensure compatibility
- [ ] Verify compliance with the UCI protocol specification
- [ ] Add adapters for other chess protocols (e.g., CECP/Winboard)
- [ ] Create examples for integration with popular chess GUIs
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with older versions of the library

## Security Considerations

- [ ] Audit code for potential security issues
- [ ] Implement input validation for all external inputs
- [ ] Consider resource limits to prevent denial of service
- [ ] Review file handling operations for potential vulnerabilities
- [ ] Document security best practices for library users
